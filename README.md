# Loop_function_project

it is a practice of how to use loop function

The first part of the challenge is to create a function that can search through a given array and find a person by a given name.
If the person with a matching name is found, the function should log the name and their position in the array. If they are not found,
the function should log that this name could not be found.

The second function you will create should take in an array of people, and return a new array with the people filtered based on a given
score. For example, if the function is called with a parameter of 50, it should return an array of all the people with a score greater 
than 50.
